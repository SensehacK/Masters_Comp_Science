# More interesting use of loops

# L1. One of the first known examples of encryption was used by Julius Caesar. Caesar needed to provide written instructions to his generals, but he didnâ€™t want his enemies to learn his plans if the message slipped into their hands. As result, he developed what later became known as the Caesar Cipher.

# The idea behind this cipher is simple (and as a result, it provides no protection against modern code breaking techniques). Each letter in the original message is shifted by 3 places. As a result, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, D becomes G, etc. The last three letters in the alphabet are wrapped around to the beginning: X becomes A, Y becomes B and Z becomes C. Non-letter characters are not modified by the cipher.

# Write a program that implements a Caesar cipher. Allow the user to supply the message and the shift amount, and then display the shifted message. Ensure that your program encodes both uppercase and lowercase letters.

# Hint: you can use a string that contains all letters as your reference as shown below


alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
alphabet[0]

caeser_str = "My name is Kautilya XXXx y ZZZZzz"
caeser_list = ""

for char in caeser_str:

    if char == " ":
        caeser_list += " "
        continue

    isUpperCase = char.isupper()
    # Lowercase
    index_int = alphabet.find(char.lower())+3

    if index_int > 25:
        index_int = index_int - 26

    letter = alphabet[index_int]
    caeser_list += letter.upper() if isUpperCase else letter


print(caeser_list)
